            <h1>Hello</h1>
            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hello, I'm Yujen Maharjan, and I'm currently a student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (Bcs). As someone who is passionate about technology and its role in shaping the world we live in, I'm excited to be studying a field that's at the forefront of innovation and progress.

                Aside from academics, one of my biggest hobbies is cycling. There's something freeing about being out on the road, feeling the wind in my hair and the sun on my face. It's a great way to clear my head and get some exercise in the process.
                
                As for my career aspirations, I hope to one day work in a technology-related field where I can use my skills to make a positive impact. Whether it's developing new software or designing more efficient systems, I believe that technology can be a force for good in the world, and I'm eager to be a part of that.
                
                Thanks for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. I'm excited to see what the future holds, and I'm looking forward to the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.</p>
